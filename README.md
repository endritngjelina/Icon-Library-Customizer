# Icon Library Customizer

A lightweight, front‚Äëend‚Äëonly playground for exploring and styling icon libraries.  
No frameworks, no build tools‚Äîjust HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The repo includes several standalone versions so you can see different UI/UX approaches and pick what you like.

> **Note:** This project is purely front end. There is no server, database, or build step.

## Why this exists

When testing icon sets, it's handy to quickly try sizes, spacing, and simple styles, then copy the snippet you need. This repo is a small, self‚Äëcontained sandbox for exactly that.

---

## What‚Äôs inside

You‚Äôll find multiple HTML files, each a complete page on its own:

- `icon library customizer 0.html`
- `icon library customizer 1.html`
- `icon library customizer 2.html`
- `icon library customizer 3.html`
- `icon library customizer 4.html`
- `icon library customizer 5.html`

Each version experiments with slightly different layout/controls/interactions. Use whichever one fits your workflow.

Other files:
- `LICENSE` ‚Äî MIT license
- `README.md` ‚Äî you‚Äôre reading it üôÇ

## Quick start

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open any of the `icon library customizer *.html` files **directly in your browser** (double‚Äëclick is fine).
3. Play with the UI (controls vary by version) and copy the HTML/CSS/JS snippets you need.

> Tip: Because each HTML file is standalone, you can drag one into any project as a starting point.

## Features (vary slightly by version)

- Clean, front‚Äëend‚Äëonly setup (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Simple controls for trying common icon styles (e.g., size, color, spacing, alignment)
- Copy‚Äëready snippets for quick reuse
- Multiple UI/UX variations so you can compare and remix

---

## Tech stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

No frameworks or bundlers required.

---

## Customizing

- Edit the CSS inside each HTML file to adjust layouts, gaps, and hover states.
- If you want to try a different icon set, swap the icon markup (SVG, webfont classes, etc.) in the HTML.
- JS is kept minimal and readable so you can tweak behavior easily.

---

## Roadmap / Ideas

- Optional: dark mode toggle
- Optional: grid/list view switcher
- Optional: ‚ÄúCopy as SVG‚Äù and ‚ÄúCopy as <i> class‚Äù options
- Optional: local ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù (still front‚Äëend only)

If you want any of these, open an issue and say which version you‚Äôre using.
